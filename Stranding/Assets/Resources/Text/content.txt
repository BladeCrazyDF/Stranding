// Comments start with "//"
// Comments will not be picked up by the parser, so you may add as much as you want

// It is recommended to keep track of the loop when you write this file, with a line of comment
// In this demo, the size of the loop is 6, set the actual size to something bigger like 36 in the actual game I guess
// Loop: 1

// A valid statement must start with a tag, showing which event it is
// We only have 3 event types now, [Notif], [Choice] and [Null]
// The payload follows the type tag directly

[Notif]This is a notification, it is the beginning of the 1st loop
[Notif]A second notification, there will be no event at next block
[Null]
// Whenever we have a choice, specify two outcomes
[Choice]Make a choice here [Option1]You choose option 1, here is the notification [Option2]You choose the other option
[Null]
[Notif]Last event in the loop

// After we reach the end of the 1st loop, it just wraps back
// Loop: 2

[Notif]First event in the second loop
[Notif]Continue on
